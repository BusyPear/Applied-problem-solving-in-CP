I have learnt a lot about competitive programming in this project and also how to approach and various method to solve a problem.  
I am using CP handbook and the gfg pages given by the mentor as reference.   
The week wise problems given by the mentor focus on a specific topics and vary from week to week which help us to understand each topic better.  
The topics i learned and used as week-wise are:  
week1: Basic Loops, maths and number theory, recursion.  
week2: Range queries, math logic.  
week3: various questions on binary search.  
week4: Binary search and partition problems.  
week5: various questions on string.  
and also using dp for some questions.
