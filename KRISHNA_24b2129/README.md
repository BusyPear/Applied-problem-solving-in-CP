SOC helps me alot in my coding journey as
1. it build my foundation of programming in language proficiency specially in c++, 
2. it improve my problem solving techniques such as brute force,greedy algorithm,searching algorithm and many more.
3. it also give me data structure mastered in array ,vector,string,stack,set and many more
4. in this i have practice a lot of ques which help me to know the most optimal solutions
5. from solving such ques again and again i recognised the most optimal pattern for solving that perticular problem.


during this journey i have also faced a lot of problems like:
Debugging logic errors
Optimizing brute-force solutions to meet time constraints
Understanding time and space complexity in-depth

And i hope this will help me a lot in next half of the project.
